                I'm Tawhida Ritu. I'm a professional web developer. I spend my whole day, practically every day,
                expermenting
                with HTML, CSS, & JavaScript; dabbling with Python & Ruby; & inhaling a wide variety of potentially
                useless
                information through a few hundred RS feeds. I build websites that delight & information. I do it well.
                I'm
                curious, & i enjoy work that challenges me to learn something new & stretch in a different direction. I
                do my
                best to stay on top of changes with tools well suited to the job at hand.

                To become a Web Developer, you should have an understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's also
                recommended to learn about CSS and CSS frameworks. Developing these fundamental web development
                skills will give you the foundation and logic for communicating with programming languages.
